                Hello my name is Jovan, and my favorite NFL team is the New York Giants. I was born in the Bronx, New York and became a fan through my father and uncles. Every sunday we would get together sit back, relax, and watch football. Despite moving to Jacksonville, Florida I still remain a die-hard fan of the Giants.

            <h2 class="home-text">History</h2>
            <p class="home-text">
                The Giants have a rich history including four super bowl championships. I was was 9 years old when they won their most recent super bowl against the New England Patriots in 2012. Unfortunately the past few years have not been so pleasant as a Giants fan. Ever since their infamous miami boat picture before a playoff game, the Giants hold the worst record during this span with a record of 22-59.

            <h2 class="home-text">Future</h2>
            <p class="home-text">
                Win or lose I will always bleed blue and support my favorite team. This last offseason we fired our head coach Joe Judge and our general manager Dave Gettleman. We replaced them with Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen of the Buffalo Bills and us fans hope they can carry over some of the sucess they had in Buffalo. I have high hopes for the future of the team and hope to experience another super bowl victory in the future.
